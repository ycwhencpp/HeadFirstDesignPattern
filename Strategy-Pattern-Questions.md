Here are some questions related to the **Strategy Design Pattern**, inspired by its discussion in the book **"Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software"** (commonly referred to as the Gang of Four book): 

---

### **Basic Understanding**
1. What is the primary intent of the Strategy Design Pattern, as described in the book?  
2. How does the Strategy Pattern promote adherence to the Open/Closed Principle in Object-Oriented Design?  
3. Why is composition preferred over inheritance in the Strategy Pattern, and how does this principle apply to its implementation?

---

### **Design and Implementation**
4. What are the key participants in the Strategy Design Pattern, and how do they interact with one another?  
5. In the book, how is the Strategy Pattern decoupled from the Context class? Why is this decoupling important?  
6. Explain how the Strategy Pattern helps in avoiding conditional statements, such as large `if-else` or `switch` blocks, in the client code.

---

### **Practical Use Cases**
7. Can you provide an example from the book or elsewhere where the Strategy Pattern is used to solve a real-world problem?  
8. How would you use the Strategy Pattern to design a payment processing system with multiple payment methods (e.g., credit card, PayPal, bank transfer)?  

---

### **Advanced Topics**
9. How does the Strategy Pattern allow for dynamic behavior changes at runtime, and what are the tradeoffs of this approach?  
10. Compare the Strategy Pattern with the State Pattern. In what scenarios might you choose one over the other?  
11. How does the book suggest managing dependencies between the Context and Strategy objects?  

---

### **Code and Testing**
12. Write a simple implementation of the Strategy Pattern to model different sorting algorithms (e.g., `QuickSort`, `MergeSort`, `BubbleSort`).  
13. In your implementation, how would you unit test the Strategy Pattern to ensure each behavior works as expected?  

---

### **Discussion and Critiques**
14. The book mentions that the Strategy Pattern can sometimes increase the number of objects in the system. Do you think this is a fair tradeoff? Why or why not?  
15. In your opinion, what are some limitations of the Strategy Pattern that the book might not explicitly discuss?
